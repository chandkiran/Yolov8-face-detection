Face Detection and Tracking using YOLO & KCF
Overview
This project implements face detection using YOLO and face tracking using Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF). A user can manually select a face using a mouse callback, which is then recognized and tracked. Even if the person leaves the frame and returns, tracking continues. The selected faceâ€™s bounding box changes color from green to red.
